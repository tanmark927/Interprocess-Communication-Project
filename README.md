# Interprocess-Communication-Project
This program is an event tracking system in which three senders and two receivers communicate with each other using one message queue. The senders send events in the form of randomly generated integers that are divisible by a marker value such as 251, 997 and 257. The receivers get events from the senders, output the message and send an acknowledgement message back to the original sender. All five components are intended to terminate on a given condition, and execution must begin with the 251 &amp; 997 receiver because that is where the message queue is allocated.
